TO FIX

-2 Setup PWA feature allowing push messages to phone OS.  
    We know push notifications will never work on iPhones, so not sure how many iPhone users there are.  Probably most people.
    Better to ping a message to ME that contains the message that I can copy to whatsapp!
    So, I am continuing with WPA if I can get it to send a notification to me.
    * Write a socket.io server to server.
    * Write a working socket.io client that will continuously try to connect and send a message every 1 minute.
    * Get working on real site on HTTPS

    This is now in it's own branch.
    I decided to keep the socket.io for reporting of agent string so we can see what people are using.
    I will implement WebPush API by storing a PushSubscription per user (in Sheets DB).
    I will improve the hidden /notifications page to get it to work for me only.  All notifications will get sent to me first.
    Then we need to write a message sending system that decides which messages get sent out on a cron.
    Email and Push messages are possible.

    * BUT FIRST, write a script that reports when a player hasn't done their predictions for an upcoming match yet.
    
-1 Add FORM of last 5 matches to the PL table AND to the prediction list
-1 Banker tables: See a players banker performance.
        Team, Times chosen, Correct, Incorrect, Success Rate, Bonus Points, Penalty Points, Total points

0. Remove keys from the docker image, this is bad practise
0. Cleanup CSS
0. Split up the Results component to make things cleaner

1. Link to Mikes recaps on the results feed
1. Change title of the predictions page to say the week # (can we do this without SSR?)
1. Highlight the winner of the week either by bolding the name, or creating a new section.
1. Add total correct colspan=3 cell
1. Add previous position in results table and up, down, across arrows. (2nd column)




# Big Features


1. Make the Teams Table - This will be interesting
    Grid of teams by players and how many points in total they have from their matches (including banker points)
    Highest scoring happy face
    Accolade name or CONTESTED

2. Create an audio section where players can record tips for each other
    Recordings are stored locally, (can we covert to mp3 before upload?)
        Yes, use: https://github.com/zhuker/lamejs
    You can only make 1 tip per week
    Only open it up to Robin first?

3. Create front page standings graph with floating faces, league table, weeks slider, colours etc

4. Player pages, "Choose a lad", show image and stats, bio, accolades, points by week, points by team, show table if all predictions correct

## TODO

3. Begin with event based solution example using event tooling repo.
    A consumer should console.warn if RECONNECTING for more than 10 minutes, every 10 minutes.
        Not sure we can detect mongo connection drop though.
