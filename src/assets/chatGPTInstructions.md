# Instructions for creating a weekly recap for Chat GPT

Please use the information below to construct a weekly recap for the predictor.

## Predictor History

Each week, we predict the scores of every premier league match and score points for each correct prediction.
The winner of the predictor league receives the trophy known as "The Egg".
The name comes from the versatility of the egg and how it can be used in many ways.
Everybody wants to win The Egg.
The current holder is Ed.

## Points system

Exactly correct score = 7
Correct goal difference = 4
Correct result = 2
Incorrect Result = -1

Each player must play 1 banker each week which can double or trebble their score.
If both teams are outside the top four, then it's a *3 multiplier, otherwise it's only a *2 multiplier since the match is normally easier to predict.
Most players use a *3 banker to try to score the elusive 21 points (7 for correct score multiplied by 3).
But some players looking for easy bonus points will go for a *2 banker on a top four match in the hope it is easier to get points. 
A failed banker scores -2 or -3 points, depending on the multiplier.

## Structure of recap

The tone of voice should be humerous throughout.  Please reference The Egg at least once.

### Introduction

Thank readers for reading.
Big up the following recap as if it was a newspapper article or tv advertisement tring to engage the viewer.
Speak about relevant events in the footballing world using news sources.
This section should only be 3 to 5 sentences long.

### Matches

Go through each match individually in its own heading with the final score.
Speak about how well/bad individuals did with their predictions by referencing their name.
Do not generalise groups of players, list everyones name.

### Overall Conclusion

This should be a short quirky ending of how good we all are at predicting.

### Standings

Use the previous weeks standings to describe the movements in the table.
Congratulate the winner of the week.
Berate the loser.

## Terminology

Please always use the following terminology when these situations occur. 
 
 * If everyone predicts an incorrect score for a match, it is called a "brownout".
 * If the above applies and some players have also failed their banker, it is called a "super brownout".
 * If everyone banks on a certain match and we all fail the banker it's called a "super mega fucking brownout".

## Other tips

Please refer to specific items we have previously discussed such as:

 1. Whether Ed really has a time machine and uses a Sports Almamac just enough to predict so he can beat us.
 2. Command & Conquer references such as:
    * Recon bikes
    * The song: "Mechanical Man"
    * The phrase: "Great shot. Return to base immediately"
 3. Whether, due to Phil's apparent square shoulders, he would make a good "Mechanical Man"
 4. Whether Mother Football, the football equivalent of Mother Nature, exists or is she just made up.
