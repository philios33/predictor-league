# Instructions for creating a weekly recap for Chat GPT

Please use the information below to construct a weekly recap for the predictor.

## Predictor History

Each week, we predict the scores of every premier league match and score points for each correct prediction.
The winner of the predictor league receives the trophy known as "The Egg".
The name comes from the versatility of the egg and how it can be used in many ways.
Everybody wants to win The Egg.
The current holder is Ed.

## Points system

Exactly correct score = 7
Correct goal difference = 4
Correct result = 2
Incorrect Result = -1
Missed Prediction = -1

Each player must play 1 banker each week which can double or trebble their score.
If both teams are outside the top four, then it's a *3 multiplier, otherwise it's only a *2 multiplier since the match is normally easier to predict.
Most players use a *3 banker to try to score the elusive 21 points (7 for correct score multiplied by 3).
But some players looking for easy bonus points will go for a *2 banker on a top four match in the hope it is easier to get points. 
A failed banker scores -2 or -3 points, depending on the multiplier.
If a player doesn't enter a prediction in time, they score -1 automatically.
Players typically go for safe 1-0, 2-0, 1-1 or 2-1 scores since they seem to be the most frequent results so any other prediction is remarkable.

## Structure of recap

The tone of voice should be humerous throughout.  Please reference The Egg at least once.

### Introduction

Thank readers for reading.
Big up the following recap as if it was a newspapper article or tv advertisement tring to engage the viewer.
Speak about relevant events in the footballing world using news sources.
This section should only be 3 to 5 sentences long.

### Matches

Go through each match individually in its own heading with the final score.
Speak about how well/bad individuals did with their predictions by referencing their name.
Don't generalise players, specify names.
Don't list what every player scored, only mention the remarkable.

### Overall Conclusion

This should be a short quirky ending of how good we all are at predicting.

### Standings

Use the previous weeks standings to describe the movements in the table.
Congratulate the winner of the week.
Berate the loser.

## Terminology

Please always use the following terminology when these situations occur. 
 
 * If everyone predicts an incorrect score for a match, it is called a "brownout".
 * If the above applies and some players have also failed their banker, it is called a "super brownout".
 * If everyone banks on a certain match and we all fail the banker it's called a "super mega fucking brownout".

## Other tips

Use the phrase "Farke Me" for the Leeds match, as a pun relating to Leeds manager Farke.

Since these matches were on different days, please add a breakdown after each day about how well everyone was doing. 

Please also comment on specific situations in matches where players got screwed over by a late goal, or an unnecessary consolation. 

Please refer to specific items we have previously discussed such as:

 1. Mike posted a photo of a funny t-shirt with the text "Bury me in my egg t-shirt" which he is thinking of purchasing. Will he do it?
 2. Mike lives in Tunbridge Wells and they have had water supply problems for a while now. The wrong chemical got in to the system.
 3. Whether FIFA should bother using VAR for corners, or would it slow the game down too much and make it boring?
 4. Command & Conquer phrase: "Great shot. Return to base immediately"
 5. Jhon Durhan "nutted" somebody and got sent off for Fenerbache. We are wondering if he will be suspended for the upcoming Villa game next year.
 6. The first three results are 0-1 5-4 2-2 which sound like a telephone area code. Maybe Mother Football is trying to phone somebody in Keith, Scotland
 7. Ed claims to have mislaid the Almanac, but is it just a lie?
 8. After 3 matches, Dave commented that he has a 35 point difference to Lawro and that it was "a fucking disgrace"
 9. Jez referred to Aston Villa as Unsustainable FC, even though they won.
 10. Dave broke the website trying to put in really high scoring predictions for the weekend matches.
